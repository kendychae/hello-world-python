**Target Length:** 4-5 minutes  
**Assignment:** CSE310 Module 1 - Rust Programming Language

---

## Video Script & Timing

### [0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION (20 seconds)

- "Hi, I'm Kendahl Bingham, and this is my Rust learning project for CSE310 Module 1."
- "I built an interactive task manager to demonstrate Rust fundamentals."
- "Let's walk through the code and see it in action."

### [0:20-1:30] CODE WALKTHROUGH - Part 1: Data Structures (70 seconds)

**Show `main.rs` starting from line 1**

- "First, I defined a Task struct with id, description, and completed status"
- Scroll to show the `Task` implementation
- "I implemented methods for creating and displaying tasks"
- Scroll to show `TaskManager` struct
- "The TaskManager uses a Vec to store tasks and tracks the next ID"
- Point out: "This demonstrates Rust's ownership system - the TaskManager owns its tasks"

### [1:30-2:30] CODE WALKTHROUGH - Part 2: Core Functionality (60 seconds)

**Show TaskManager methods**

- Scroll through `add_task`, `list_tasks`, `complete_task`, `delete_task`
- "Here I'm using Rust's pattern matching with if-let statements"
- "The mutable references with `&mut self` show Rust's borrowing rules"
- Point to `iter_mut()` and `find()` usage
- "These iterator methods demonstrate Rust's functional programming style"
- Show the `get_stats` method
- "Using filter and count to calculate statistics"

### [2:30-3:30] DEMONSTRATION (60 seconds)

**Open terminal in VS Code**

- "Let's compile and run the program"
- Run: `cargo build`
- Show successful compilation message
- Run: `cargo run`
- Show the welcome screen with demo tasks
- **Demonstrate features:**
  - Option 2: List tasks (show the 3 demo tasks)
  - Option 1: Add a new task (e.g., "Practice Rust ownership concepts")
  - Option 3: Complete task #1
  - Option 2: List tasks again (show completed task with checkmark)
  - Option 5: View statistics
  - Option 6: Exit

### [3:30-4:10] RUST CONCEPTS LEARNED (40 seconds)

- "Through this project, I learned several key Rust concepts:"
- Show code while mentioning:
  - "Ownership and borrowing - managing memory safely"
  - "Structs and implementations - organizing code"
  - "Pattern matching - handling different cases elegantly"
  - "Error handling with Option and Result types"
  - "Iterators and functional programming patterns"

### [4:10-4:30] GITHUB REPOSITORY (20 seconds)

- Switch to browser with your GitHub repo
- "The complete code is available on GitHub"
- Show repository structure briefly
- Show README.md content

### [4:30-4:50] LEARNING REFLECTION (20 seconds)

- "Rust's ownership system was challenging but teaches important memory safety concepts"
- "Coming from Python, I appreciate how Rust catches errors at compile time"
- "I'm excited to explore more advanced Rust features in future projects"

### [4:50-5:00] CLOSING (10 seconds)

- "Thanks for watching! Link to the repository is in the description."
- Show repo URL on screen: github.com/kendychae/rust-learning-project

## Pre-Recording Checklist

- [ ] Rust is installed (`rustc --version` and `cargo --version` work)
- [ ] Test compile with `cargo build` - ensure no errors
- [ ] Test run with `cargo run` - verify all features work
- [ ] Commit and push all code to GitHub
- [ ] Create new repository named "rust-learning-project" or similar
- [ ] Update README.md with actual video link after recording
- [ ] Test video link to ensure it works
- [ ] Have GitHub repository page ready to show
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications
- [ ] Clear terminal for clean demonstration

---

## Code Demonstration Sequence

1. Start at top of `main.rs` - show imports
2. Show `Task` struct definition
3. Show `Task` implementation methods
4. Show `TaskManager` struct
5. Show `TaskManager` implementation methods (scroll through each)
6. Show `main()` function with menu loop
7. Run the program and demonstrate all features

## Key Rust Concepts to Mention

✅ **Ownership**: TaskManager owns the Vec of tasks  
✅ **Borrowing**: `&self` for reading, `&mut self` for modifying  
✅ **Structs**: Task and TaskManager data structures  
✅ **Enums**: Used in pattern matching  
✅ **Pattern Matching**: match statement for menu options, if-let for Option handling  
✅ **Iterators**: `iter()`, `iter_mut()`, `filter()`, `find()`, `position()`  
✅ **Error Handling**: Using Option and unwrap appropriately  
✅ **String Types**: String vs &str

## Recording Tips

- Zoom in on code (Ctrl+= or Cmd+=) for readability
- Use VS Code's "Zen Mode" (Ctrl+K Z) for distraction-free recording
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Pause briefly between sections
- If you make a mistake, pause, then start that section again
- Keep energy and enthusiasm in your voice!
