# Overview

As a software engineering student and single mother of two, I created this Hello World program to demonstrate my foundational programming skills and establish my development environment for future projects. This marks the beginning of my journey in applied programming where I will explore multiple languages and technologies throughout this course.

This is a simple Python program that displays a personalized greeting message to demonstrate basic output functionality and program structure.

The purpose of creating this software is to verify my development environment setup, practice version control with Git and GitHub, and establish a professional workflow that I'll use for more complex projects this semester.
