## 💡 Tips for Success

### Video Recording

- **Test first:** Do a 30-second test recording to check audio/video
- **Environment:** Record in a quiet place with good lighting
- **Energy:** Be enthusiastic! Show your passion for learning
- **Mistakes:** If you make a small mistake, keep going - authenticity matters
- **Length:** Aim for 4-5 minutes (don't go over 6 minutes)

### GitHub

- **Repository name:** Make it descriptive and professional
- **README:** Ensure it displays properly on GitHub (preview before finalizing)
- **Commits:** Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Public:** Verify the repository is public, not private

### Reflection Questions

- **Be honest:** Share your genuine learning experience
- **Be specific:** Use examples from your code
- **Show growth:** It's okay to mention challenges - it shows learning
- **Proofread:** Check for spelling and grammar
